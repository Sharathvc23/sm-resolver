"""``__version__`` must equal the installed distribution version.

A literal is a second copy of pyproject's ``version`` with nothing comparing
them. That is not a hypothetical shape in this org: sm-provision 0.1.0 shipped
``__version__ == "0.0.1"`` against correct dist metadata, and sm-authority 0.1.0
shipped the same wrong value from the same template. sm-bridge 0.6.0 then
"fixed" its version by correcting the *value* — its wheel still carried a
literal, so it was set to drift again at the next bump.

sm-resolver was correct at the time of this change. That is the point: correct-today
is exactly the state these were all in right before they drifted, so the guard
below asserts on the *duplication* rather than on the value.
